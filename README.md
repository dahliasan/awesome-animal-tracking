- [heatwaveR](https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/)

### GLS
- [SGAT](https://github.com/SWotherspoon/SGAT) - for filering and smoothing GLS locations 

### Locations
- [aniMotum](https://github.com/ianjonsen/aniMotum) - fit latent variable movement models to animal tracking data
- [SDLfilter](https://github.com/TakahiroShimada/SDLfilter) - pre-processing gps/argos locations, and assess if sample size of tracking data is good enough for animal distribution analysis.
- [seaTracks](https://github.com/davo-b-green/seaTracks) - Dowloading, compiling and processing satellite biotelemetry data from the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) Data Portal

### Movement summary metrics
- [triapse](https://github.com/Trackage/traipse) - tools to calculate common metrics of distance, direction, and speed


### Plotting
- ggplot2
- sf
- marmap
- mapview (interactive maps)
- [KUD3D](https://github.com/vinayudyawer/KUD3D) - A helper R package to estimate and interactively visualise 3D KUD models of animal telemetry data.

### Analysis
- [track2KBA](https://github.com/BirdLifeInternational/track2kba) - tools to identify significant animal aggregations for conservation by analyzing tracking data, summarizing foraging trips, estimating utilisation distributions, and pinpointing key aggregation areas.
- [trakR](https://github.com/abfleishman/trakR) - split trips, calculate trip fidelity.
